TODO:
- rename serverhandler to something more usefull
- replace clienthandler class with a more suitable one
* clienthandler should be the base class that handles the events only
- reimplement a way to connect shell stdin to the stdin of the calling process
* find a way to transform Qt keyboard events into INPUT_RECORD structures (transform that into an input queue)
* make it possible to connect either another console input queue or a Qt input queue to the target process
- add a very simple way to get output from the console buffer
